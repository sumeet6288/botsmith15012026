# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ WHITE LABEL FEATURE FULLY FIXED (2025-12-12): Fixed two critical bugs preventing white label feature from working properly. BUG #1: Non-existent method - chatbots.py was calling plan_service.get_user_plan() which doesn't exist, causing backend errors when saving powered_by_text. FIX: Changed to use plan_service.get_usage_stats() and extract plan from response structure. BUG #2: Missing field in public API - PublicChatbotInfo model and public_chat.py endpoint were not including powered_by_text field, so live preview never showed custom branding even after successful save. FIX: Added powered_by_text field to PublicChatbotInfo model and included it in get_public_chatbot endpoint response. RESULT: White label feature now works end-to-end: (1) Appearance tab detects user's plan correctly, (2) Paid users can save custom powered_by_text, (3) Public chat widget displays custom branding immediately after save, (4) Cache invalidation ensures fresh data. All changes applied and backend restarted successfully."

        comment: "✅ WHITE LABEL TEXT VANISHING & WIDGET BUG FIXED (2025-12-XX): Fixed two additional critical bugs reported by user. BUG #1: Text vanishing in Appearance tab - After saving powered_by_text, the input field would automatically become empty after some time. ROOT CAUSE: AppearanceTab component was not syncing local state when chatbot prop changed. FIX: Added useEffect hook to sync customization state whenever chatbot prop updates, ensuring powered_by_text persists. BUG #2: Custom branding not showing in fast-widget.js - Changes were visible in live preview but NOT in the embedded widget. ROOT CAUSE: fast-widget.js had hardcoded 'Powered by BotSmith' text and never read powered_by_text from API. FIX: Created updateBrandingFooter() function that reads powered_by_text from chatbot data and dynamically updates widget footer. If powered_by_text is empty/null, footer is hidden completely (true white label). If custom text provided, shows 'Powered by [Custom Text]'. Modified loadChatbot() to call updateBrandingFooter(). RESULT: White label feature now fully functional across all interfaces: (1) Text persists in Appearance tab input field, (2) Widget reflects custom branding from database, (3) Consistent behavior between live preview and embedded widget, (4) True white label mode (hidden footer) works correctly. Documentation created in WHITE_LABEL_BUG_FIX.md. All dependencies installed, services running, bug completely resolved."

    message: "🔧 GOOGLE GEMINI AI PROVIDER FIX (2025-01-09): Fixed critical bug where Google Gemini models were not responding when selected in chatbot configuration. ROOT CAUSE: Provider name mismatch - the application used 'google' as provider name in database/frontend, but emergentintegrations library expects 'gemini' as provider name. When user selected Google model, the API call failed with error 'Invalid model name passed in model=gemini-2.0-flash-lite' because provider was being set as 'openai' (due to litellm default). THE FIX: 1) Modified /app/backend/services/chat_service.py to add provider mapping that converts 'google' → 'gemini' before calling emergentintegrations library (lines 58-67). 2) Updated available models list to include correct Gemini models: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.0-flash-lite (lines 95-99). 3) Added newer OpenAI models (gpt-5.2, gpt-5.1) and Anthropic models (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) to backend list (lines 86-94). 4) Updated frontend /app/frontend/src/utils/models.js to include all working models: OpenAI (gpt-5.2, gpt-5.1, gpt-4o-mini), Anthropic (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929, claude-3-5-haiku-20241022), Google (gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.0-flash-lite). TESTING: Created and ran comprehensive test script /app/test_google_gemini.py which successfully verified: ✅ Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite returns 'Hello from Gemini!' response, ✅ Gemini 2.5 Flash returns 'Gemini 2.5 Flash works!' response. Both tests passed confirming provider mapping works correctly. VERIFICATION: Backend automatically reloaded with hot reload. All Gemini models now working perfectly through emergentintegrations with EMERGENT_LLM_KEY. Users can now select any Google/Gemini model and receive proper AI responses. Documentation: Provider mapping transparently handles 'google' to 'gemini' conversion so existing chatbots continue working without database migration."

    message: "🔐 GOOGLE OAUTH DASHBOARD DATA LOADING FIX (2025-01-05): CRITICAL BUG FIXED - After successful Google OAuth authentication via Supabase, users were redirected to /dashboard but ALL dashboard APIs returned 500 Internal Server Error, causing zero data to load. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The User model in /app/backend/models.py had password_hash as REQUIRED field (line 14: password_hash: str). OAuth users authenticate via Google and don't have passwords, so when backend tried to create User object from MongoDB document, Pydantic validation failed with error: 'Field required [type=missing, input_value={...password_hash: ''...}]'. This caused get_current_user() dependency to crash on every authenticated API call. THE COMPLETE FLOW: 1) User clicks 'Sign in with Google' → 2) Supabase OAuth succeeds → 3) Frontend calls /api/auth/supabase/callback with Supabase token → 4) Backend verifies token, syncs user to MongoDB (password_hash=''), issues APPLICATION JWT → 5) Frontend stores JWT in localStorage as 'botsmith_token' → 6) Frontend redirects to /dashboard → 7) Dashboard calls chatbotAPI.list(), analyticsAPI.getDashboard(), plansAPI.getUsageStats() → 8) Axios interceptor adds Authorization header with JWT → 9) Backend get_current_user() tries to create User object → 10) ❌ FAILS: password_hash field missing/empty causes validation error → 11) All dashboard APIs return 500. THE FIX: Changed User model (line 14 in /app/backend/models.py): FROM: password_hash: str (required), TO: password_hash: Optional[str] = '' (optional with empty default). This allows OAuth users (Google, etc.) to have empty password_hash while maintaining compatibility with legacy email/password users. SUPABASE CONFIGURATION: Added Supabase credentials to both .env files: Backend .env: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET. Frontend .env: REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL, REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY. Backend /api/auth/supabase/status endpoint now returns configured:true. TESTING: Created comprehensive test scripts (test_google_oauth_flow.py, test_supabase_callback.py) that verify: 1) Supabase token verification ✓, 2) User sync to MongoDB ✓, 3) Application JWT generation ✓, 4) Dashboard API authentication ✓. All tests passing with 200 OK responses. VERIFIED WORKING: GET /api/chatbots (returns empty list for new user), GET /api/analytics/dashboard (returns 0 chatbots/conversations/messages), GET /api/plans/usage (returns Free plan). Backend restarted (PID 665). FILES MODIFIED: /app/backend/models.py (User model password_hash field), /app/backend/.env (Supabase config), /app/frontend/.env (Supabase config). RESULT: Google OAuth users can now successfully authenticate AND access dashboard with all data loading correctly. No more 500 errors. Dashboard displays user-specific data immediately after login."

    message: "🎯 SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL MODEL TESTING COMPLETE (2025-12-22): Successfully completed comprehensive testing of subscription renewal model as requested. ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFIED: The December 22, 2025 renewal bug fix is working perfectly - active subscriptions extend from current_expires_at + 30 days (preserving remaining days), expired subscriptions start fresh from now + 30 days. ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED (46/46 - 100% success rate): Created comprehensive backend_test.py and tested all required APIs with 2 test users (user1@test.com expiring in 2 days, user2@test.com expired 5 days ago). 1) /api/plans/subscription-status: Correctly returns expiration status and days remaining. 2) /api/plans/renew: CRITICAL - User1 renewal extended from 2025-12-25 to 2026-01-24 (preserved 2 remaining days + 30 new = 32 total), User2 renewal started fresh from now to 2026-01-21 (30 days from renewal time). 3) /api/plans/current: Both users retrieve complete subscription details. 4) /api/plans/usage: Usage stats with limits correctly returned. 5) Edge cases: Multiple renewals work, usage counters preserved, billing cycle maintained. 🔧 BUSINESS LOGIC VERIFIED: Users no longer lose remaining days when renewing early. The fix prevents the previous bug where users would only get 30 days total instead of 30 days ADDED to remaining time. Both test users successfully renewed and can continue using the service with proper subscription extensions."

    message: "🎨 ACCENT COLOR BUG FIXED (2025-12-15): Fixed critical bug where accent_color was not storing in database despite being set in UI. ROOT CAUSE: The accent_color field was MISSING from backend data models (Chatbot, ChatbotUpdate, ChatbotResponse). It only existed in PublicChatbotInfo model, causing the field to be silently ignored during updates. Frontend was working correctly - backend was the issue. FIXES APPLIED: 1) Added accent_color field to Chatbot model with default value '#ec4899', 2) Added accent_color as Optional[str] to ChatbotUpdate model, 3) Added accent_color to ChatbotResponse model, 4) BONUS FIX: Also added missing bubble_style field to all three models for consistency. VERIFICATION: Database test confirmed accent_color now stores and retrieves correctly. Backend restarted successfully (PID updated). IMPACT: Users can now set custom accent colors in Appearance tab and they will persist across sessions. Color applies to chatbot widget, live preview, public chat pages, and embedded widgets. Default accent color is #ec4899 (pink/magenta). Documentation created in ACCENT_COLOR_FIX.md with detailed analysis and testing instructions.

    message: "⚡ APPEARANCE TAB LAG FIX - COMPLETE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (2025-12-12): Fixed critical performance issue where Appearance tab was extremely laggy when saving settings. ROOT CAUSE: Synchronous blocking API calls - when user clicked Save, the UI would freeze for 2-5 seconds due to sequential await calls: 1) chatbotAPI.update() to save settings, 2) onUpdate() (refreshChatbot) to fetch entire chatbot data. This blocking pattern existed in ALL 5 save/update operations (save appearance, upload logo, upload avatar, remove logo, remove avatar). SOLUTION: Converted all onUpdate() calls from BLOCKING to NON-BLOCKING fire-and-forget pattern: Changed 'await onUpdate()' to 'onUpdate().catch(err => console.error())'. OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED: ✅ handleSave() - main save function now returns instantly after API update ✅ handleLogoUpload() - logo upload provides instant feedback ✅ handleAvatarUpload() - avatar upload provides instant feedback ✅ handleRemoveLogo() - logo removal responds instantly ✅ handleRemoveAvatar() - avatar removal responds instantly. BENEFITS: Save button responds immediately (no lag), success message appears instantly, chatbot data refreshes in background without blocking UI, error resilience (refresh errors don't affect save operation). PERFORMANCE IMPACT: User experience changed from 'Save → Wait 2-5 seconds → Success' to 'Save → Instant Success → Continue working'. Documentation created in APPEARANCE_TAB_LAG_FIX.md with detailed technical analysis. All services running: Backend (PID 36), Frontend (PID 37) compiled successfully, MongoDB (PID 38).

    message: "🔧 WHITE LABEL PLAN CHANGE BUG FIX (2025-12-XX): Fixed critical bug where white label feature wasn't reflecting when admin changed user's plan from admin panel to paid plan. ROOT CAUSE: The get_usage_stats() API endpoint was returning plan info (id, name, price) but NOT including the 'limits' object which contains the 'custom_branding' flag. Frontend AppearanceTab.jsx checks userPlan?.limits?.custom_branding to show/hide white label input field. Without limits in response, frontend always thought user didn't have custom_branding even after plan upgrade. FIX APPLIED: Modified /app/backend/services/plan_service.py line 456 to include 'limits' in plan object returned by get_usage_stats(). Now when admin updates user plan via Ultimate Edit modal, the limits (including custom_branding) are properly returned to frontend. Backend restarted successfully.

COMPREHENSIVE FIX APPLIED: 1) PUBLIC CHAT API (public_chat.py lines 88-93): Added status check that raises HTTP 400 error with message 'This chatbot is currently inactive. Please contact the chatbot owner.' when status != 'active'. 2) DISCORD INTEGRATION (discord.py): Added status check that sends inactive message to Discord channel and returns early. 3) TELEGRAM INTEGRATION (telegram.py): Added status check that sends inactive message to Telegram chat and returns early. 4) WHATSAPP INTEGRATION (whatsapp.py): Added status check that sends inactive message to WhatsApp and returns early. 5) INSTAGRAM INTEGRATION (instagram.py): Added status check that sends inactive message to Instagram DM and returns early. 6) MESSENGER INTEGRATION (messenger.py): Added status check that sends inactive message to Messenger and returns early. 7) MS TEAMS INTEGRATION (msteams.py): Added status check that sends inactive message to Teams channel and returns early. CACHE INVALIDATION: Confirmed chatbots.py toggle endpoint (lines 229-232) already has cache invalidation using cache_service.delete(f'chatbot:{chatbot_id}') which clears both regular cache and public cache. RESULT: When chatbot is toggled to inactive, all channels (widget, embed, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, MS Teams) immediately stop processing messages and inform users the chatbot is inactive. System reinitialized after memory limit exceeded, all fixes preserved and verified. All services running: Backend (PID 36), Frontend (PID 37), MongoDB (PID 38).

    message: "✅ NEW SUBSCRIPTION MODEL IMPLEMENTED (2026-01-02): Successfully implemented simplified subscription model that eliminates billing confusion. CORE CHANGES: When users upgrade from FREE to any PAID plan (Starter/Professional/Enterprise), the paid subscription now starts FRESH with exactly 30 days from payment/upgrade date - NO carry-forward of remaining FREE plan time. This provides predictable billing: users always know paid plans = 30 days. RENEWAL LOGIC PRESERVED: When users renew their SAME paid plan before expiration, remaining days are preserved (e.g., 5 days left + 30 days renewal = 35 total days). FILES MODIFIED: 1) /app/backend/services/plan_service.py - Updated upgrade_plan() to always start fresh from now, added comprehensive documentation. 2) /app/backend/routers/razorpay_payment.py - Enhanced verify_payment() logic to distinguish between UPGRADE (start fresh) vs RENEWAL (extend from current). 3) /app/backend/routers/admin_subscriptions.py - Fixed change_user_plan() to reset expires_at when admin changes user plan, ensuring fresh start with full duration. BENEFITS: No billing confusion (users get full 30 days on paid plans), fair for business (FREE time doesn't extend into paid), predictable UX, preserves renewal benefits. DOCUMENTATION: Created comprehensive /app/NEW_SUBSCRIPTION_MODEL.md with implementation details, user scenarios, testing guide, and support responses. Backend restarted successfully (PID 722).

    message: "✅ SUBSCRIPTION UPGRADE DOUBLE EXTENSION BUG - FULLY FIXED (2025-01-XX): Fixed critical bug where users upgrading from FREE to PAID plans were getting 59-65 days instead of exactly 30 days. ROOT CAUSE: The Razorpay webhook handler sync_subscription_to_main_collection() was ALWAYS extending expires_at by 30 days, even for plan upgrades (not just renewals). When a user upgraded from FREE (6 days) to Starter (30 days), the webhook would extend the FREE expiration instead of starting fresh: expires_at = FREE_expiration + 30 days (resulted in 35+ days). Multiple webhook firings or race conditions caused the stacking to reach 59-65 days. THE FIX: Modified /app/backend/routers/razorpay.py → sync_subscription_to_main_collection() function (lines 200-280) to DISTINGUISH between PLAN UPGRADE and RENEWAL. Added logic: 1) Detect plan change by comparing old_plan_id with new plan_id, 2) If plan changed (UPGRADE): Start fresh with exactly 30 days from now (no carry-forward from old plan), 3) If same plan (RENEWAL): Extend from current expiration (preserve remaining days). Added comprehensive logging to track 'Plan upgrade detected - starting fresh' vs 'Renewal detected - extending from current'. TESTING SCENARIOS VERIFIED: ✅ FREE → Starter upgrade: Gets exactly 30 days (not 35), ✅ Starter → Professional upgrade: Gets exactly 30 days (not 45), ✅ Starter renewal: Gets current remaining + 30 days (preserves time). FILES MODIFIED: /app/backend/routers/razorpay.py - sync_subscription_to_main_collection() function with upgrade detection logic. DOCUMENTATION: Created comprehensive /app/SUBSCRIPTION_UPGRADE_FIX.md with root cause analysis, code flow, testing scenarios, and business rules. Backend restarted successfully (PID 819).

    message: "🔒 PAYMENT IDEMPOTENCY FIX IMPLEMENTED (2025-01-02): Implemented comprehensive payment idempotency to fix the root cause of subscription double extension bug. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The 59-65 days bug was caused by MULTIPLE code paths processing the SAME payment: 1) /api/razorpay/verify-payment endpoint (frontend calls this), 2) /api/razorpay/webhook (Razorpay fires this, sometimes multiple times), 3) /api/razorpay/payment-callback (redirect after payment). None of these endpoints had idempotency checks, so when webhooks fired twice or both callback AND webhook arrived, the subscription got extended MULTIPLE times (30 days each time). IDEMPOTENCY SOLUTION: Created processed_payments collection to track payment IDs. Before processing ANY payment, check if payment_id exists. If already processed, skip the update. If not processed, add payment_id to collection and proceed. This ensures each payment is processed EXACTLY ONCE. CODE CHANGES: 1) Modified sync_subscription_to_main_collection() in razorpay.py - Added payment_id parameter, idempotency check at start, record insertion after processing. 2) Updated webhook handler in razorpay.py - Extract payment_id from payload, pass to sync function. 3) Updated payment callback in razorpay.py - Extract payment_id, pass to sync function. 4) Updated /verify-payment endpoint in razorpay_payment.py - Check razorpay_payment_id in subscriptions, early return if processed. 5) Updated webhook in razorpay_payment.py - Extract payment_id, check if processed, include in subscription update. DATABASE CHANGES: Created processed_payments collection with fields (payment_id, user_id, subscription_id, plan_id, processed_at, expires_at, is_upgrade). Created 5 indexes for efficient lookups: payment_id+user_id (unique), user_id, processed_at, subscription_id, razorpay_payment_id on subscriptions. TESTING: All 5 tests passed - First payment processes correctly (30 days), duplicate webhook blocked, callback blocked, all indexes exist, payment records complete. BENEFITS: Prevents duplicate processing, consistent UX (exactly 30 days), accurate billing, audit trail, fast lookups. FILES MODIFIED: /app/backend/routers/razorpay.py (sync function, webhook, callback), /app/backend/routers/razorpay_payment.py (verify endpoint, webhook). SCRIPTS CREATED: /app/backend/scripts/create_payment_idempotency_index.py (creates indexes), /app/backend/scripts/test_idempotency_fix.py (verification tests). DOCUMENTATION: Created comprehensive /app/IDEMPOTENCY_FIX.md with root cause, solution, testing, monitoring. Backend restarted (PID 817).

    message: "✅ SIGNIN/SIGNUP WHITE SPACE FIX COMPLETE (2025-01-05): Fixed critical CSS bug causing non-clickable white space at bottom of SignIn and SignUp pages. ROOT CAUSE: Two CSS rules were breaking viewport height calculations: 1) Global CSS index.css line 123: #root { zoom: 0.8 } - The 0.8 zoom broke viewport height calculations causing browser to miscalculate dimensions. 2) App.css line 2: .App { min-height: 100vh } - Forced extra height on App container. Combined, these caused white space ONLY on short pages designed for exactly 100vh (SignIn/SignUp). THE FIX: Removed both problematic CSS rules. 1) Removed #root { zoom: 0.8 } from /app/frontend/src/index.css - Allows browser to correctly calculate viewport units (vh), h-screen class now properly translates to actual screen height. 2) Removed .App { min-height: 100vh } from /app/frontend/src/App.css - Eliminates forced minimum height, auth pages naturally fit viewport. VERIFICATION RESULTS: ✅ SignIn page (/signin): Viewport 800px = Content 800px (perfect fit, no white space). ✅ SignUp page (/signup): Viewport 800px = Content 800px (perfect fit, no white space). ✅ Landing page (/): 5244px scrollable content working correctly. ✅ Dashboard and all other pages: No layout shift or issues. IMPACT: CSS-only solution with no JSX changes, no component logic changes, no Google Auth changes, no padding/margin hacks. Clean fix that resolves the issue without side effects. FILES MODIFIED: /app/frontend/src/index.css (removed zoom from #root), /app/frontend/src/App.css (removed min-height from .App). DOCUMENTATION: Created comprehensive /app/WHITESPACE_FIX.md.

user_problem_statement: "🔒 PAYMENT IDEMPOTENCY FIX COMPLETE (2025-01-02): Fixed critical bug where users upgrading from FREE (6 days) to Starter paid plan (30 days) received 59-65 days instead of exactly 30 days. ROOT CAUSE: Multiple code paths (verify-payment endpoint, webhook, callback) processed the SAME payment without idempotency checks, causing multiple 30-day extensions. SOLUTION: Implemented payment idempotency using processed_payments collection. Each payment is now processed EXACTLY ONCE regardless of how many webhooks/callbacks fire. Created database indexes for efficient idempotency checks. Modified all payment processing endpoints to check payment_id before processing. FILES MODIFIED: razorpay.py (sync function, webhook, callback), razorpay_payment.py (verify endpoint, webhook). TESTING: All 5 automated tests passed - idempotency working correctly. RESULT: Users now get exactly 30 days on upgrade (no carry-forward from FREE plan), renewals preserve remaining days, no revenue leakage, audit trail available. Documentation: /app/IDEMPOTENCY_FIX.md. Backend restarted (PID 817). Issue COMPLETELY resolved."

        comment: "🔧 ADMIN PLAN CHANGE DURATION BUG FIXED (2025-01-XX): Fixed critical bug where admins changing user plans via Ultimate Edit modal resulted in incorrect subscription durations. ISSUE: When admin changed user from FREE to Starter plan, subscription sometimes got only 5-6 days instead of 30 days. UI showed correct plan and 'active' status, but expiration date was calculated using free-plan duration (6 days) instead of paid-plan duration (30 days). ROOT CAUSE: The /api/admin/users/{user_id}/ultimate-update endpoint was updating the plan_id field in both users and subscriptions collections, but NOT updating the subscription's expires_at date. It only changed the plan_id without recalculating subscription duration based on the new plan. CODE FLOW: 1) Admin changes plan via Ultimate Edit modal → 2) Frontend sends plan_id to ultimate-update endpoint → 3) Endpoint updates plan_id in user doc → 4) Endpoint updates/creates subscription but sets expires_at=None (for new) or keeps old expires_at (for existing) → 5) Result: User has new plan_id but old expiration date. THE FIX: Modified /app/backend/routers/admin_users.py lines 1693-1728 (ultimate-update endpoint) to properly calculate subscription duration when plan changes. LOGIC IMPLEMENTED: 1) Fetch plan details from database, 2) Determine duration: 6 days for 'free', 30 days for all paid plans (starter/professional/enterprise), 3) Calculate: started_at = NOW, expires_at = started_at + duration, 4) Update subscription with new plan_id AND proper dates, 5) Log action with duration info. SCENARIOS FIXED: ✅ FREE → Starter: Gets exactly 30 days (was getting 5-6 days), ✅ FREE → Professional: Gets exactly 30 days, ✅ Starter → Professional: Gets fresh 30 days, ✅ Professional → FREE: Gets exactly 6 days. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Added timedelta calculation, comprehensive logging with emoji indicators, proper datetime handling, maintains 'active' status, resets started_at to current time. BENEFITS: Correct subscription duration for admin plan changes, no more billing confusion, predictable behavior, consistent with payment gateway logic. FILES MODIFIED: /app/backend/routers/admin_users.py (ultimate-update endpoint, lines 1693-1728). Backend restarted successfully (PID 1388). Dependencies reinstalled. Ready for testing."

        comment: "✅ MOCKED DATA REMOVED - FULLY FUNCTIONAL ANALYTICS (2025-01-XX): Fixed critical issue where analytics tab was displaying mocked/fake data instead of real database information. PROBLEM: Frontend Analytics.jsx was generating fake trend data with random variations (generateTrendData), mock response times (3-5s random), and mock satisfaction rates (75-95% random). None of the graphs showed actual user data. SOLUTION: 1) BACKEND - Created new /api/analytics/trends endpoint in analytics.py that aggregates real time-series data across ALL user's chatbots (not just one). Endpoint accepts days parameter (7, 30, 90) and returns: conversations array with date/count, messages array with date/count, calculated average response time from actual message timestamps. Added calculate_avg_response_time() helper function that analyzes conversation message pairs to compute real response times (formats as ms, s, or m:s). 2) FRONTEND - Added getTrends() method to analyticsAPI in api.js. Removed generateTrendData() mock function completely. Removed calculateAvgResponseTime() mock function. Updated loadDashboardAnalytics() to call real API endpoint and use returned data directly. Kept calculateSatisfaction() with estimated logic based on message engagement (no rating system exists). RESULT: All graphs now display REAL data from database: Conversation Over Time (area chart) shows actual daily conversation counts, Message Volume (bar chart) shows actual daily message counts, Average Response Time card shows calculated time from real message timestamps, AI Provider Distribution (pie chart) uses real chatbot provider data, Performance Metrics (line chart) displays real conversation trends. TECHNICAL DETAILS: Backend aggregates data from conversations and messages collections, groups by date with proper formatting ('Jan 15' format), calculates response time by analyzing user→bot message pairs, handles empty states gracefully (returns 0s when no data). FILES MODIFIED: /app/backend/routers/analytics.py (added trends endpoint, calculate_avg_response_time function), /app/frontend/src/utils/api.js (added getTrends method), /app/frontend/src/pages/Analytics.jsx (removed mock functions, integrated real API calls).

        comment: "✅ SCOPED WHITE SPACE FIX COMPLETE (2025-01-06): Improved fix to be properly scoped ONLY to auth pages, preserving global app behavior. ISSUE WITH PREVIOUS FIX: Removing global CSS rules (zoom: 0.8 and min-height: 100vh) could affect other pages that depend on them. SCOPED SOLUTION: 1) Created AuthRouteDetector component in App.js that detects /signin and /signup routes and adds 'auth-route' class to #root element, 2) Restored global CSS rules (zoom: 0.8 and min-height: 100vh), 3) Added scoped CSS overrides in index.css: #root.auth-route { zoom: 1 } and #root.auth-route .App { min-height: unset }. HOW IT WORKS: When user navigates to auth pages, AuthRouteDetector adds 'auth-route' class which triggers scoped CSS overrides (zoom: 1, no min-height). On all other routes, class is removed and global styles apply (zoom: 0.8, min-height: 100vh). VERIFICATION RESULTS: ✅ SignIn page: auth-route class applied, zoom: 1, min-height: 0px, viewport 800px = content 800px (no white space). ✅ SignUp page: auth-route class applied, zoom: 1, viewport 800px = content 800px (no white space). ✅ Landing page: NO auth-route class, zoom: 0.8 (global), min-height: 800px (100vh) - original behavior preserved. ✅ Pricing page: NO auth-route class, zoom: 0.8 (global) - original behavior preserved. BENEFITS: Surgical precision (fixes ONLY auth pages), zero impact on other routes, maintainable (easy to add routes), production-safe, no JSX changes to SignIn/SignUp. FILES MODIFIED: App.js (added AuthRouteDetector component, integrated in AppContent), index.css (restored global zoom, added scoped overrides), App.css (restored min-height).

Message processing: Receives messages from Slack channels/DMs via Events API webhook, generates session_id from channel and user_id, creates/updates conversations in MongoDB, fetches knowledge base context using vector store, generates AI responses using ChatService with multi-provider support (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini), sends responses back to Slack with thread support, updates subscription usage (messages_this_month), logs all integration events. Frontend: Added handleSetupSlackWebhook function that calls setup endpoint and displays instructions, added Slack webhook setup button (green with Zap icon) next to test/delete buttons when Slack integration is configured, webhook URL logged to console with detailed setup steps. Setup process: User adds Slack bot token in UI, clicks webhook setup button (⚡), gets webhook URL and instructions, manually configures Events API in Slack App settings (https://api.slack.com/apps), subscribes to bot events (message.channels, message.im, message.groups), bot receives messages and responds with AI in real-time.

    message: "✅ ADMIN CONVERSATIONS TESTING COMPLETE: The reported issue with messages not showing in the Admin Panel Conversations modal has been resolved. Testing confirmed that all 4 conversations display their messages correctly when 'View Messages' is clicked. The backend API endpoints are working properly (GET /api/admin/conversations and GET /api/chat/messages/{id} both return correct data). The modal opens successfully and shows the complete conversation history with proper formatting. The user-reported bug appears to have been fixed in a previous update. No further action needed - feature is fully functional."

    message: "CRITICAL FIX - Integration Messages Not Counting on Dashboard: Fixed Telegram integration (and future integrations) not incrementing subscription message count on dashboard. Root cause: Telegram webhook message handler (process_telegram_message in telegram.py) was only updating chatbot.messages_count but NOT calling plan_service.increment_usage() to update subscription usage statistics. Fix applied: Added subscription usage tracking to telegram.py line 174-178 - now increments usage by 2 (user + assistant messages) when processing Telegram messages, same as regular chat and public chat endpoints. Messages from all channels (web chat, public widget, Telegram integration) now properly count towards subscription limits and display correctly on dashboard plan card."

    message: "CRITICAL FIX - Message Count Tracking: Fixed dashboard message count not reflecting widget/public chat messages. Root cause: Public chat endpoint was only updating chatbot.messages_count but not subscription.usage.messages_this_month. Fix applied: 1) Updated public_chat.py to call plan_service.increment_usage() after each message exchange (increments by 2 for user+assistant messages), 2) Fixed chat.py regular endpoint to increment by 2 instead of 1. Now all messages from both public widget and regular chat properly update the subscription usage statistics displayed on dashboard plan card."

Root cause: ChatRequest model in models.py was missing required fields (chatbot_id, user_name, user_email) that chat.py endpoint was trying to access. Also fixed ChatResponse to use 'message' instead of 'response' field for consistency with public_chat.py. Updated both ChatRequest and PublicChatRequest models to include all necessary fields. Backend restarted successfully. Chatbot messaging should now work correctly."

Root cause: Chatbot model was missing 'status' field, causing all chatbots to be rejected when chatbot.get('status') returned None. Fix applied: 1) Added 'status' field to Chatbot model with default value 'active', 2) Added 'status' to ChatbotResponse and ChatbotUpdate models, 3) Updated existing chatbot in database to have status='active', 4) All new chatbots will now be created with status='active' by default.

        comment: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - MS TEAMS INTEGRATION NOT FUNCTIONAL: Comprehensive testing revealed 2 critical blocking issues preventing MS Teams integration from working. ✅ CODE IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS: MS Teams router (/app/backend/routers/msteams.py) and service (/app/backend/services/msteams_service.py) are fully implemented with 6 endpoints: POST /api/msteams/webhook/{chatbot_id} (receive Teams messages), POST /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/setup-webhook (generate webhook URL), GET /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/webhook-info (get webhook config), DELETE /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/webhook (remove webhook), POST /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/send-test-message (test message sending). MSTeamsService includes authentication (OAuth2 token), message sending, credential validation, conversation management. ❌ ISSUE #1 - ROUTER NOT REGISTERED: MS Teams router is imported in server.py line 8 but NEVER registered with api_router. Missing line: api_router.include_router(msteams.router). Result: All MS Teams endpoints return 404 Not Found. ❌ ISSUE #2 - INTEGRATION TYPE NOT ALLOWED: Integration model in models.py line 849 only allows: 'slack', 'telegram', 'discord', 'whatsapp', 'webchat', 'api', 'twilio', 'messenger' but NOT 'msteams'. Result: Cannot create MS Teams integration - returns 422 validation error. ✅ TESTING RESULTS: 19 comprehensive tests executed, 31.6% success rate (6/19 passed). Failed tests: Create integration (422 - type not allowed), test connection (404 - router not registered), setup webhook (404), get webhook info (404), toggle integration (404), delete integration (404). Passed tests: Invalid ID handling, error validation, integration logs API. ✅ INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT APIs WORKING: The general integration management endpoints (GET/POST/DELETE /api/integrations) work correctly for other integration types (Slack, Telegram, Discord tested successfully). MS Teams just needs to be added to allowed types and router registered. REQUIRED FIXES: 1) Add 'msteams' to Integration model's Literal type in models.py line 849, 2) Add 'msteams' to IntegrationCreate model's Literal type in models.py line 862, 3) Register MS Teams router in server.py: api_router.include_router(msteams.router).

      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: "✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Direct Login feature was not properly storing authentication credentials, causing impersonation to fail. ROOT CAUSE: DirectLogin.jsx was using wrong localStorage keys - it was storing 'token' and 'user' instead of 'botsmith_token' and 'botsmith_user', which are the keys that AuthContext expects. This meant the authentication system never recognized the impersonated user session. FIX APPLIED: 1) Updated DirectLogin.jsx to clear all old session data first (both old and new key formats), 2) Changed localStorage.setItem('token', token) to localStorage.setItem('botsmith_token', token), 3) Changed localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user)) to localStorage.setItem('botsmith_user', JSON.stringify(user)), 4) Removed obsolete 'isAuthenticated' flag, 5) Enhanced success toast to show user role for verification, 6) Changed redirect from navigate('/dashboard') to window.location.href = '/dashboard' to force full page reload ensuring AuthContext picks up new user properly. BACKEND VERIFIED: admin_direct_login.py correctly generates JWT tokens with user's actual role (not admin), tested with test user showing role='user' in token. FLOW NOW WORKS: Admin clicks Direct Login → Backend generates token with target user's data and role → DirectLogin page stores credentials with correct keys → Full page reload to /dashboard → AuthContext reads botsmith_token and loads user with correct role → User is now properly impersonated with their actual permissions and dashboard view, NOT admin view."

FRONTEND FIXES (fast-widget.js): 1) Added customization state object with defaults for accent_color, font_family, font_size, and bubble_style, 2) Created getBubbleRadius() helper function to map bubble_style to border-radius values (rounded: 18px, smooth: 12px, square: 4px), 3) Created getFontSize() helper function to map font_size to pixel values (small: 14px, medium: 16px, large: 18px), 4) Updated updateContainerStyle() to apply font_family to entire widget container, 5) Updated renderMessages() to use accent_color for bot avatar background (instead of hardcoded secondary color), use getBubbleRadius() for message bubble border-radius, use getFontSize() for message text size, and apply font_family to all messages, 6) Updated showTyping() to use accent_color and bubble_style for typing indicator, 7) Updated loadChatbot() to read accent_color, font_family, font_size, and bubble_style from API response and apply them to customization state, then re-render existing messages. RESULT: All 3 customization options now work correctly in the embedded fast-widget - accent color changes bot avatar background, bubble style changes message bubble corners (rounded/smooth/square), and font customization (family and size) applies to all widget text."
